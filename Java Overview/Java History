History: Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991.
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the
Green team initiated the Java language in 1991.

Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0.
It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms.
Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications.
With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.
At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status.
Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007,
Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution terms.

The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded,
interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the Father of Java.
Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.
